Entity Relationship Structure
The database uses a relational model with clear entity relationships. The users table serves as the central entity linking to role-specific tables. Academic structure tables manage years, semesters, and clearance periods. Organizational structure tables define sectors, departments, and programs. Clearance system tables track forms, signatories, and approvals.

Core Tables
The users table stores account information for all system users. The students table contains student-specific data with sector assignments. The faculty table stores faculty employment information and department assignments. The staff table manages staff members with designations. The roles and permissions tables define access control structures.

Academic Structure Tables
The academic_years table stores school year information. The semesters table contains term data linked to academic years. The clearance_periods table manages sector-based clearance periods with status tracking. Relationships ensure data integrity across academic structures.

Clearance System Tables
The clearance_forms table stores individual clearance applications. The clearance_signatories table tracks signatory assignments and actions for each form. Signatory assignments are managed directly through the clearance_signatories table based on designations and department assignments.

Supporting Tables
The audit_logs table records all system activities. The user_activities table tracks user interactions. The system_settings table stores configuration values. The rejection_reasons table provides predefined rejection options. These tables support system functionality and accountability.

Database Features
Stored procedures automate clearance period creation and closure. Views simplify complex queries for active periods and form information. Triggers enforce business rules such as single active academic year and automatic form ID generation. Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity.

SYSTEM WORKFLOWS

Clearance Application Workflow
Students and faculty access their dashboards to view active clearance periods. They click Apply for Clearance to submit applications. The system creates clearance forms and signatory entries automatically. Users track approval status through their clearance pages. Signatories review and approve or reject requests. The system updates status in real time.

Signatory Approval Workflow
Signatories access their dashboards to view assigned clearance forms. They review form details and user information. They approve or reject requests with optional comments. Batch operations allow approving multiple forms simultaneously. The system updates clearance form progress based on signatory actions. Users receive status updates immediately.

Administrative Setup Workflow
Administrators create academic years and semesters. They activate terms for clearance operations. They assign signatories to sectors and departments. They start clearance periods for each sector. The system automatically creates forms for eligible users. Administrators monitor clearance progress through dashboards and reports.

Data Import Workflow
Administrators access import functionality in user management pages. They select import type and upload data files. The system validates file format and data structure. Validation checks ensure required fields and data formats. The system creates user accounts and role-specific records. Import summaries show success and error counts.

Report Generation Workflow
Users select report type and parameters through export modals. They choose file format and filter criteria. The system queries database for report data. ReportGenerator processes data and applies templates. The system generates PDF or Excel files. Users download generated reports.

PROBLEM SOLUTIONS

Manual Process Inefficiency
The manual clearance process required physical document handling and in-person signatures. The system eliminates physical interactions by providing digital submission and approval. Users submit applications online without visiting offices. Signatories review and approve requests through their dashboards. This reduces processing time and eliminates document loss.

Status Tracking Difficulties
Manual processes made it difficult for users to track clearance status. The system provides real-time status tracking through user dashboards. Users see which signatories approved or rejected their clearance. Progress indicators show completion percentage. Status updates appear immediately when signatories take action. This provides transparency and reduces inquiries.

Signatory Assignment Complexity
Manual processes required complex coordination for signatory assignments. The system automates signatory assignment through the clearance signatories table. The system creates signatory entries automatically when clearance periods start based on designations and department assignments. Signatories see only forms assigned to their departments or sectors. This ensures proper workflow distribution.

Document Management Issues
Physical documents were prone to loss and damage. The system stores all clearance data in a centralized database. PDF generation provides printable forms when needed. Digital storage eliminates document loss. Search and filter functions enable quick record retrieval. This improves data security and accessibility.

Approval Process Delays
Manual approval processes caused delays due to scheduling conflicts. The system enables signatories to review and approve requests at their convenience. Batch approval operations process multiple forms efficiently. Digital comments guide users on resolving issues. This accelerates the approval process.

Data Entry Errors
Manual data entry introduced errors and inconsistencies. The system validates all data inputs before storage. Bulk import validates file formats and data structures. Database constraints enforce data integrity. Automated form creation reduces manual entry errors. This improves data accuracy.

Reporting Limitations
Manual reporting required time-consuming data compilation. The system generates reports automatically from database queries. Role-based reports provide appropriate data access. Multiple export formats support different needs. This saves time and ensures report accuracy.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
