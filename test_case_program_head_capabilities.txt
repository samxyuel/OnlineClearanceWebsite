The table should display student information including student number, name, program, year level, section, account status, and clearance status with appropriate status badges. The pagination system should work correctly with configurable entries per page options. The bulk selection functionality should allow selecting multiple students with bulk action buttons for approve, reject, mark graduated, reset clearance, and delete operations.

Step 6: Test clearance signing and approval capabilities for students
Expected Results: The program head should be able to approve individual student clearances by clicking the approve button, which should display a confirmation modal asking for approval confirmation. Upon confirmation, the clearance status should update to "Approved" with appropriate visual feedback and success notification. The program head should be able to reject student clearances by clicking the reject button, which should open a rejection remarks modal allowing selection of rejection reasons and additional remarks. Upon submission, the clearance status should update to "Rejected" with the rejection details recorded and appropriate notifications displayed.

Step 7: Test bulk clearance operations and management functions
Expected Results: The program head should be able to select multiple students using checkboxes and perform bulk operations including bulk approval, bulk rejection, marking students as graduated, resetting clearance status for new terms, and bulk deletion. The bulk selection filters modal should allow filtering students by account status and clearance progress for efficient bulk selection. Each bulk operation should display appropriate confirmation modals with clear descriptions of the action and affected student count. Upon confirmation, the operations should execute successfully with updated statistics and appropriate success notifications.

Step 8: Test faculty management capabilities within assigned sectors
Expected Results: The program head should be able to view, search, and filter faculty data within their assigned sectors, displaying faculty information including employee number, name, department, employment status, and clearance status. The program head should be able to approve or reject faculty clearances with appropriate confirmation modals and status updates. The faculty management interface should include faculty-specific filters and bulk operations similar to student management but tailored for faculty data and requirements.

Step 9: Test data import and export functionality
Expected Results: The program head should be able to access import functionality through the Import button, which should open an import modal allowing selection of file types and import options for student or faculty data. The export functionality should be accessible through the Export button, opening an export modal with options to export student data, faculty data, clearance reports, and statistics in various formats. Both import and export operations should work correctly with appropriate file validation, progress indicators, and success/error notifications.

Step 10: Test department statistics and reporting capabilities
Expected Results: The program head should be able to view comprehensive department statistics including program-wise student distribution, clearance status breakdown, and departmental performance metrics. The statistics should update dynamically based on current data and filter selections. The program head should be able to generate and export detailed reports showing clearance progress, completion rates, and departmental analytics. The reporting system should provide various report formats and filtering options for different time periods and data categories.

Step 11: Test access control and security restrictions
