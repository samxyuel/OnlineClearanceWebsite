All navigation links should be functional and redirect to the correct admin pages. The sidebar should also display account-related links including Profile, Settings, and Logout in the account section. The navigation should be responsive and work properly on both desktop and mobile devices with appropriate toggle functionality.

Step 11: Test admin dashboard quick actions and term management functionality
Expected Results: The admin dashboard should display functional quick action cards for accessing different management modules with proper icons and descriptions. The active period status section should show current term information with accurate statistics and provide functional buttons for deactivating or ending the current term with appropriate confirmation dialogs. The quick statistics cards should display real-time data and be properly formatted. The recent activity section should show actual system activities with timestamps and appropriate icons for different activity types.

Step 12: Test data export and reporting functionality across admin pages
Expected Results: Admin pages should provide export functionality for data tables and reports with options for different formats such as CSV, Excel, and PDF. The export features should work properly for student data, faculty information, staff records, clearance statistics, and audit trail data.

Users should be able to select multiple students, faculty, or staff members using checkboxes and perform bulk actions such as status updates, role assignments, or data exports. The system should provide selection counters showing the number of selected items and enable/disable bulk action buttons based on selection state. Bulk operations should include appropriate confirmation dialogs and success/error messaging.

Step 15: Test system responsiveness and error handling in admin interface
Expected Results: The admin interface should be fully responsive and work properly across different screen sizes and devices. All admin pages should load within acceptable time limits and display appropriate loading indicators during data operations. The system should handle errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages and provide fallback options when operations fail. Network connectivity issues should be handled appropriately with retry mechanisms and clear communication to users about system status.
