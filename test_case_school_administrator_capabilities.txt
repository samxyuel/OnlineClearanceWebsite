The page should show college student statistics, comprehensive search and filtering options for college students across all departments, data table displaying college student information including names, student numbers, programs, departments, clearance status, and management actions. The interface should provide bulk operations for managing multiple college students, clearance signing capabilities, and student record editing functionality with appropriate scope indicators showing school-wide access permissions.

Step 3: Test navigation to Senior High School Student Management page and verify its functionality
Expected Results: The Senior High School Student Management page should load with the correct header displaying "Senior High School Student Management" and appropriate description about managing SHS students across all departments. The page should present SHS-specific statistics, search and filter capabilities for senior high school students, comprehensive data table showing SHS student information including names, student numbers, grade levels, departments, clearance status, and management options. The page should include bulk action features for managing multiple SHS students, clearance signing functionality, and student record management with clear indication of school-wide access scope for senior high school departments.

Step 4: Test navigation to Faculty Management page and verify school administrator capabilities
Expected Results: The Faculty Management page should display the proper interface with "Faculty Management" header and description about editing faculty records and signing clearances across all departments. The page should show faculty-specific statistics, search and filtering functionality for faculty members across all departments, data table displaying faculty information including names, employee numbers, departments, employment status, clearance status, and management actions. The page should provide capabilities for editing faculty records, managing employment status, signing faculty clearances, and monitoring faculty clearance progress with appropriate bulk operation support and clear scope indicators.

Step 5: Test school administrator sidebar navigation and role-based access control
Expected Results: The school administrator sidebar should display appropriate navigation links including Dashboard, College Student Management, Senior High School Student Management, Faculty Management, and Audit Trail in the main menu section. The navigation should NOT include system administration features like Clearance Management, Staff Management, or Course Management that are reserved for full admin users. All available navigation links should be functional and redirect to the correct school administrator pages. The sidebar should also display account-related links including Profile, Settings, and Logout in the account section with proper responsive behavior.

Step 6: Test clearance signing functionality and signatory override capabilities
Expected Results: The school administrator should have access to clearance signing functionality across all student and faculty clearances within their scope. The system should provide signatory override capabilities allowing the school administrator to temporarily assume signatory responsibilities for specific staff positions when needed. The signatory override modal should display position selection options including MIS/IT, Cashier, Registrar, Library, Accounting, and Student Affairs, with appropriate warnings about temporary staff account disabling during override sessions. The system should show pending clearances preview and allow the school administrator to sign clearances on behalf of absent or unavailable staff members.

Step 7: Test school-wide reporting and export functionality
Expected Results: The school administrator should have access to comprehensive reporting capabilities for generating school-wide clearance reports. The export functionality should work for student data, faculty information, and clearance statistics across all departments within the school administrator's scope. Export operations should include options for different formats such as CSV, Excel, and PDF with appropriate filtering options to export specific data sets. The system should provide school-wide clearance status reports, department-wise statistics, and comprehensive clearance completion reports with proper confirmation dialogs and success messaging.

Step 8: Test search and filtering capabilities across all school administrator management pages
Expected Results: All school administrator management pages should provide comprehensive search functionality allowing users to search by names, identification numbers, departments, programs, or other relevant criteria across all departments within their scope. Filter options should be available for status, department, program, clearance state, and other relevant attributes with school-wide coverage. Search and filter operations should work in real-time without requiring page refreshes and should maintain filter states when navigating between different sections. The system should provide clear indicators of active filters and options to clear all filters while maintaining the school-wide access scope.

Step 9: Test bulk operations and multi-selection functionality in school administrator pages
Expected Results: School administrator management pages should support bulk operations for managing multiple records simultaneously across all departments within their scope. Users should be able to select multiple students or faculty members using checkboxes and perform bulk actions such as status updates, clearance signing, or data exports. The system should provide selection counters showing the number of selected items and enable/disable bulk action buttons based on selection state. Bulk operations should include appropriate confirmation dialogs and success/error messaging with proper scope validation to ensure operations are limited to the school administrator's authorized departments.

Step 10: Test department scope validation and access control enforcement
Expected Results: The school administrator should have access to all departments within the school but should not have access to system administration functions reserved for full admin users. All pages should display clear scope indicators showing "School-wide Access" or "All Departments" to indicate the extent of the school administrator's permissions. The system should prevent access to admin-only features like clearance period management, staff management, course management, and system configuration while allowing full access to user management and clearance signing within the school administrator's scope. Any attempts to access restricted features should result in appropriate error messages or redirection.

Step 11: Test current period monitoring and read-only access to clearance periods
Expected Results: The school administrator dashboard should display current clearance period information in read-only format, showing active term details, duration, start dates, and completion statistics. The system should NOT provide buttons for deactivating or ending terms, as these functions are reserved for full admin users. The current period status section should show comprehensive statistics including total students, faculty, completed clearances, and pending signatures with real-time updates. The school administrator should be able to view period information and generate reports but should not be able to modify clearance period settings or system configuration.

Step 12: Test school overview and department statistics functionality
Expected Results: The school administrator dashboard should display a comprehensive school overview section showing department-wise statistics and clearance status breakdown. The department overview should list all departments with student counts and clearance completion rates. The clearance status section should show detailed breakdown of completed, pending, rejected, and in-progress clearances with appropriate visual indicators and color coding. The statistics should be real-time and accurately reflect the current state of clearances across all departments within the school administrator's scope.

Step 13: Test recent activity monitoring and audit trail access
Expected Results: The school administrator should have access to recent activity monitoring showing school-wide activities including clearance approvals, rejections, record updates, and report generations. The audit trail functionality should provide comprehensive logging of all activities within the school administrator's scope with appropriate filtering and search capabilities. The system should display activity details including timestamps, user information, action descriptions, and affected records with proper formatting and chronological ordering. The audit trail should be read-only and should not allow modification of logged activities.

Step 14: Test responsive design and cross-device compatibility for school administrator interface
Expected Results: The school administrator interface should be fully responsive and work properly across different screen sizes and devices including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. All management pages should adapt appropriately to different screen sizes with proper layout adjustments, readable text, and functional interactive elements. The sidebar navigation should work correctly on mobile devices with appropriate toggle functionality and backdrop handling. All forms, tables, and interactive elements should remain functional and accessible across different devices and screen orientations.

Step 15: Test error handling and system responsiveness in school administrator interface
Expected Results: The school administrator interface should handle errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages and appropriate fallback options when operations fail. All pages should load within acceptable time limits and display appropriate loading indicators during data operations. Network connectivity issues should be handled appropriately with retry mechanisms and clear communication to users about system status. The system should provide proper validation for all user inputs and operations with clear error messaging and guidance for resolving issues. Any system errors should be logged appropriately while maintaining user experience and system stability.
